# MessageBoard App
An exercise in clean, maintanable code.

# Summary
For the last few years, I've learned many languages and frameworks.  I love programming, and I have a knack for hacking things to get them to work.  In an isolated project with one or two people, this is probably fine.  I've learned that this is not good when working on large commercial projects.  Some of my last few projects, especially from my last job and internship, contained code that was difficult for others to work with.  People were angry.

In order to redeem myself from these past sins, I'm working on this project in order to exercise better coding habits.

# Goals

- Write modular code
- Write good documentation

# Project Specs
- Let users create messages and post them on a home page (like Twitter?)
- User profiles
- User authentication
- Web interface
- Write code in a way that allows devs to add more features (i.e. chat, Mobile interface, etc.)
